# An object-oriented interface to numpyro

This package provides a wrapper for working with [numpyro](https://num.pyro.ai/) models.
It aims to remain model-agnostic, but package up a lot of the model fitting code to reduce repetition.

## Getting started


### A basic demo

TODO: include docstring / doctest?


### Development notes

1. `pipenv install`
2. `pipenv requirements > requirements.txt`
3. `pipenv requirements --dev-only > requirements-dev.txt`
4. Remove first line (`-i ...`) from the two requirements files.
5. install local package with `pipenv run pip install -e ".[dev]"`
